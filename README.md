# Abstract Factory Design Pattern Example

This is a C# example demonstrating the Abstract Factory design pattern. The example illustrates how the Abstract Factory pattern can be used to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. It creates two different "animal worlds" representing Africa and America, each with its own set of herbivores and carnivores.

## Pattern Components

- **MainApp:** This is the entry point for the application. It demonstrates the creation of animal worlds for different continents and the running of food chains.

- **ContinentFactory (Abstract Factory):** This abstract class defines the interface for creating families of related objects, specifically herbivores and carnivores.

- **AfricaFactory and AmericaFactory (Concrete Factories):** These concrete factory classes extend ContinentFactory and provide implementations for creating herbivores and carnivores specific to the African and American continents.

- **Herbivore and Carnivore (Abstract Products):** These abstract classes define the interfaces for herbivore and carnivore objects, which are created by the concrete factories.

- **Wildebeest, Lion, Bison, and Wolf (Concrete Products):** These classes are the concrete implementations of herbivores and carnivores for Africa and America.

- **AnimalWorld (Client Class):** This class represents the client in the Abstract Factory pattern. It creates herbivores and carnivores for a specific continent and runs the food chain.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Compile and run the C# program.

3. Observe how the Abstract Factory pattern is used to create animal worlds for different continents with their respective herbivores and carnivores.

## Purpose

The Abstract Factory pattern promotes the creation of families of related objects while keeping the construction process independent of the client code. It ensures that objects within a family work together cohesively and allows for easy extension or modification of families of objects.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your own use cases to better understand how the Abstract Factory pattern can be applied in software development.
